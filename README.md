# Future of SoundJournal 
Beyond our MVP, we want to continue building upon our features by implementing the following: 

* **Location-** Using Google Maps API to help users capture the location of where he/she listened to their favorite song. 
* **Social Share-** Connecting to Facebook,Instagram and Twitter to share their song memories with family and friends.
* **Notifications-** After using the application for a couple of weeks, the user will be alerted when he/she have memories to look back on.
