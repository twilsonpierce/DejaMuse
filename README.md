# Introduction 
Welcome to SoundJournal! 


# Calendar Feature 
In **SoundJournal**, every user will be given a calendar that will automatically create a timestamp for a song that he/she played on a specific day. After the user has collected enough songs overtime, it would become a timehop of music that the user will be able to create as a playlist.

# Future of SoundJournal 
Beyond our MVP, we want to continue building upon our features by implementing the following: 

* **Location-** Using Google Maps API to help users capture the location of where he/she listened to their favorite song. 
* **Social Share-** Connecting to Facebook,Instagram and Twitter to share their song memories with family and friends.
* **Notifications-** After using the application for a couple of weeks, the user will be alerted when he/she have memories to look back on.
